SUPPORTED ORGANISATIONS
Casa Guatemala
After starting life as an orphanage Casa Guatemala has evolved with the times and is now a children’s village offering free education with boarding facilities to the surrounding villages. They encourage families to maintain contact by getting children home at the weekends and holidays where possible. At Christmas they host an enormous gethering of all the families and children an awe inspiring logistical feat.
Pass It On provided a solar system in one of the volunteers dormitories and ran Water Safety Workshops there for the volunteers and staff.
